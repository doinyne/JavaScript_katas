// In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

//For example, if const firstName = "Ada", you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using firstName[firstName.length - 1].
/*
const firstName = "Ada";
const lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1];

// lastLetter would have a value of the string a.

console.log(lastLetter);
*/

// Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String

// You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.

//For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the const firstName = "Augusta" string by using firstName[firstName.length - 3]
/*
const firstNameTwo = "Augusta";
const thirdToLastLetter = firstNameTwo[firstNameTwo.length - 3];

console.log(thirdToLastLetter);
